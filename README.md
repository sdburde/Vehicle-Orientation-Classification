# Vehicle-Orientation-Classification
This project focuses on classifying vehicle orientations using a YOLO-based model. It includes dataset preparation, model training, and prediction workflows for evaluating test images. The model categorizes vehicles into multiple orientation-based classes and provides inference using a pre-trained TFLite model.
